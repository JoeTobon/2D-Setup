# 2D-Setup
Configuration for a 2D Game project using SDL

My project MTS is twin stick shooter set in medieval times. To play the game simply clone or download the repository, plug in a controller, and launch the exe.
My game is meant to be played primarily with a controller and will accept input from one.
