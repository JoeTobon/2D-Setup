# 2D-Setup
Verticle slice of 2D game

My project MTS is twin stick shooter set in medieval times. To play the game simply clone or download the repository, plug in an xbox one controller, and launch the exe.
My game is meant to be played primarily with a controller and will only accept input from one. Controls can be found in the main menu.
